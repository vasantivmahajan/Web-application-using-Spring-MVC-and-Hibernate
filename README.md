# A walk to remember

##Aim: 

Creating a personalized timeline for the user, a web portal where the user can cherish their personal moments and also set goals for their future. The application helps the user achieve these goals by suggesting events and activities taking place near them.

## Motivation:

In the midst of social networks and fast-paced everything, people tend to lose themselves. They often forget when and why they made the last pivotal decision, they never really remember and cherish moments from the past. People get so caught up in their present that they never channelize their future and the ways in which they can achieve their future goals.

## Proposed Idea:

A walk to remember is an application which could help you remember who you were and what you want to be by collecting and cherishing your personal moments. It helps the user set goals for themselves and suggests means by which the user can achieve their goals. For instance: if the user sets a goal of learning to develop a Spring application by the end of the semester, it can suggest the most popular online video tutorials that the user can use to study about the spring framework. It can also look for sessions or seminars conducted in the nearby vicinity that the user can attend by posting feeds on the user’s timeline. If the user finds the post helpful, he/she can pin it to their timeline and register for the session. Another user of the application would be the advertisers who post their ads. Once the user registers for these sessions, the advertiser is notified about the enrollment and have the option of approving or declining the request. The advertiser could also provide some promotional offers to attract customers. The application basically aims at helping the user connect with someone so near yet so far, themselves. 

## Key roles:

The key roles of the application are:
•	Users who want to build their timeline
•	Advertisers who post their advertisement on the application
•	Admin who approves the advertisers registering on the portal and advertisements posted by them to validate the authenticity of the advertisement

The application is build using Spring MVC architecture and Hibernate ORM.
